### Hi there ! 👋🏼<br/>
Welcome to my Dotfile Repositoty. Here you'll find <strong>my hand-riced config</strong> as well as an installation Script to link everything for you. 🤓 <br/> 
They're made for HyprLand on top of Arch 🙇🏼 (of course). So check the files first before running the setup, to make sure you have the right software. :) <br/>

## 👁👁 Some Pictures for you eyes to see
