# 👨🏻‍💻 .dotfiles
### Hi there ! 👋🏼<br/>
Welcome to my Dotfile Repositoty. Here you'll find <strong>my hand-riced config</strong> as well as an installation Script to link everything for you. 🤓 <br/> 
They're made for HyprLand on top of Arch 🙇🏼 (of course). So check the files first before running the setup, to make sure you have the right software. :) <br/>

## Installation :

First clone the repository by copy-pasting this command : (I recommend to clone it inside your Home directory but it doesn't really matter)
```
git clone https://github.com/MountainEnjoyer/.dotfiles.git
```
<br/>
Then, cd into the directory and Run the #Setup.sh# script.
```
cd .dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
